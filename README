Oratory Coach Results

This project is a simple web-based feedback system for an oratory coach application. It provides individual feedback on various aspects of a speech, including facial gestures, body gestures, posture, sentiment and tone analysis, grammar evaluation, and disfluencies detection. Each section of feedback is displayed on separate pages, and a central results overview page provides navigation links to these individual reports.

  Features
-  Facial Gestures Analysis : Smile detection, eye contact analysis, and identification of other relevant facial expressions.
-  Body Gestures Analysis : Hand movements, head movements, and engagement level assessment based on body language.
-  Posture Analysis : Evaluation of the speaker's posture throughout the speech.
-  Sentiment and Tone Analysis : Displays the two most prevalent emotions and provides feedback on tone.
-  Grammar Evaluation : Identifies grammatical correctness and highlights incorrect sections in the speech.
-  Disfluencies Detection : Detects filler words and other disfluencies, showing the percentage of disfluency in the spoken content.
-  Suggestions for Improvement : Provides feedback to improve the speaker's confidence and overall presentation.
